# completion-ruby: bash completion for Ruby-related commands

**completion-ruby** is a set of [bash][] scripts offering command-line
completion for various [Ruby][]-related commands and tools.

## Usage

Save the completion files somewhere (in the same directory) and add the
following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:

    . /path/to/completion-ruby-all

The `completion-ruby-all` script loads all the completions it finds,
but only for the commands you appear to have installed.
Alternatively, you can just save the specific scripts you wish, and
source them individually.

These scripts offer improved directory completion when `bash-completion` is
available. It should be part of pretty much any modern Linux distribution,
and you can install it on OS X using [MacPorts][]:

    sudo port install bash-completion

`bash-completion` is a dependency of [Git][]'s completion, so if you have
that working already you should be fine.

## Why yet another completion script?

Before writing my own, I'd seen about five different scripts for `rake`
completion. None of them, though, at the same time:

* cached the task list for fast results;
* invalidated said cache when the rakefile was modified;
* worked properly with namespaces; and
* worked on subdirectories of the project

...among other minor quirks. While providing all of the above, a few other
niceties were added, like command-line options completion and awareness of
task arguments.

This script is not perfect (for instance, it won't update the cache if
a dependency of the rakefile is updated; as a workaround, simply
`touch Rakefile`), but it tries to cover all the most common cases without
overcomplicating or overthinking the code.
