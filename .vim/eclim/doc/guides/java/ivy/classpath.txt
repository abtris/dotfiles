Ivy: Maintain Classpath
***********************

For users of ivy, eclim provides support for auto updating the
.classpath for your project every time you save your ivy.xml file.
Any entries found in the ivy.xml that are not in the .classpath will
be added, any entries that differ in version will be updated, and any
stale entries deleted.

*:IvyRepo*


Initial Setup
=============

Before you can start utilizing this auto updating support, you must
first set the location of your ivy repository (ivy cache).  This is
the directory where ivy will download the dependencies to and where
eclipse will then pick them up to be added to your project's
classpath.

To set the repository location you can use the :IvyRepo command which
is made available when editing an ivy.xml file.

>

   :IvyRepo /path/to/ivy/repository

<


If you fail to set this prior to writing the ivy.xml file, eclim will
emit an error notifying you that you first need to set the IVY_REPO
variable via this command.


Updating .classpath
===================

Once you have performed the initial setup, updating the Eclipse
.classpath file is as easy as saving your ivy.xml file (:w) and
letting eclim do the rest.


Preserving manually added entries
=================================

When utilizing the ivy support, eclim will attempt to remove any stale
entries from your .classpath file.  If you have some manually added
entries, these may be removed as well.  To prevent this you can add a
classpath entry attribute notifying eclim that the entry should be
preserved.

Ex.

>

   <classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/j2ee-1.4.jar">
     <attributes>
       <attribute name="eclim.preserve" value="true"/>
     </attributes>
   </classpathentry>

*:IvyDependencySearch*


Search Online Maven Repository
==============================

Eclim also provides the command :IvyDependencySearch which allows you
to search for dependencies in the online maven repository as described
in the maven documentation (|vim-java-maven-dependencies|).
