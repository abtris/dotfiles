Java / Javac Support
********************

*:Java*


Executing java
==============

To run the configured main class for your project, you may use the
:Java command, which executes java and displays the results in a
temporary buffer.

Note: Please note that this command is not intended to be a full
  replacement for the more advance support provided by eclipse, ant,
  or maven.


Configuration
=============

Eclim Settings

- org.eclim.java.run.mainclass - Fully qualified name of the class
  containing the main method.

*:Javac*


Executing javac
===============

To run the javac command on your source code, you may use the :Javac
command, which executes javac against all your source code.

Note: Please note that this command is not intended to be a full
  replacement for javac support provided by more comprehensive build
  tools like ant or maven.


Configuration
=============

Eclim Settings

- org.eclim.java.compile.sourcepath - The project relative source
  paths to be compiled by javac.  This should be a space separated
  list of project relative source directories which you want javac to
  be executed against.  When unset, all your configured source
  directories will be used.
